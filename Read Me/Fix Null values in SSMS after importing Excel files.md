After you successfully imported all Excel files to SSMS, you found that there is only Null values in your results after queries. While your original Excel files didn't have Null values.

Solution:

From your Excel file

Select columns that contain Null values - right click - format cells - texts - OK.

For some specific columns, to make sure its format is correct, you should copy columns one by one to a new Notepad. Then copy the data from Notepad back to Excel file.
